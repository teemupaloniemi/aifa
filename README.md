# Research Project: LLMs for Assessing R&D Funding Instruments

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase and related resources for a research project that aims to investigate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing research and development (R&D) funding instruments. The primary objective is to determine if LLMs can effectively recommend the best-fitting funding instruments to users based on their specific needs and criteria.

## Background

With the increasing complexity and variety of R&D funding instruments available, it becomes challenging for researchers and developers to identify the most suitable options. This project seeks to leverage the power of LLMs to simplify this process, providing users with tailored recommendations that align with their goals and requirements.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gather comprehensive data on various R&D funding instruments.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilize LLMs to process and analyze the collected data.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generate personalized funding instrument recommendations for users.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for users to input their criteria and receive recommendations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. (Coming Soon) Follow the setup instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file.
3. Run the application and input your specific criteria.
4. Receive tailored recommendations on the best-fitting R&D funding instruments.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

```git clone <repo_url>```


2. **Install Dependencies**
- Navigate to the `fundai` folder and run:
  ```npm install```
- Navigate to the `server` folder and run:
  ```npm install```

3. **Build the Project**
- In the `fundai` folder, run:
  ```npm run build```
- In the `server` folder, run:
  ```npm run build```

4. **Start the Application**
- In the `fundai` folder, run:
  ```npm start```
- In the `server` folder, run:
  ```npm start```

After following these steps, the client should be running on port 3000 and the server should be running on port 5000.
